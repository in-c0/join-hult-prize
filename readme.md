###  Our Project

Every second counts in an emergency. Yet, inefficiencies and inaccuracies in the current emergency response system often lead to delays and errors in patient care. 
Our startup idea aims to eliminate these challenges through an AI-leveraged platform that ensures quick, accurate, and effective emergency medical interventions.
